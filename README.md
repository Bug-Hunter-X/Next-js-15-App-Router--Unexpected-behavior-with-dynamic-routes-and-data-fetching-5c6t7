# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Dynamic Routes and Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when combining dynamic routes and data fetching. The issue involves unexpected rendering behavior and potential race conditions that can lead to incorrect data display or rendering errors.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests when a dynamic route attempts to fetch data asynchronously.  Under certain conditions, the component may render before the data has been fetched, leading to an empty or incomplete UI.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to a dynamic route (e.g., `/product/1`).
5. Observe the initial rendering and any subsequent updates.

## Expected Behavior

The component should display data fetched from the API after the data is successfully retrieved.

## Actual Behavior

The component might render before the data is fetched, potentially leading to an empty state or rendering errors.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a possible solution. It uses `async/await` and suspense to handle asynchronous data fetching gracefully, ensuring that the component only renders after data has been fetched successfully.
